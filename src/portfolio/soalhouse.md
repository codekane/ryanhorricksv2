This is another whole chapter in my life. I moved into the SOAL House on
February 14, 2019, because I finally got some money, and I felt the need to run
away from the street preacher I'd been shacking up with for the two weeks prior.
Truthfully, that wasn't even that bad, considering I'd shown up in the city with
my life and a backpack, and had thumbed a ride from the airport to Whyte, where
I sat in a coffee shop waiting for my friend to get home, and there I met her,
and she saved me from my friend (the Devil) but tripped all my issues in the
process, and so I ran, and I ran to where I knew I could: The SOAL House.

It's not even a real place anymore. It was, but it's last days were numbered to
those ending in August, 2020, but it was a wonderful place while it lasted. It
was an AirBnB, and it was a mansion, and it was filled to the brim with art, and
books, and it had a sunroom, and stairs, and a third story loft where I stayed
in the room with the half moon window, and door curtain. Once you got to know
that house, you could sneak any way you liked without meeting a soul you didn't
like to see.

There was a sugar shack out back where we all liked to go to smoke, and that's
where the idea for this site was born...

I'll tell you more another day. This one was made in Jekyll, without a template,
because I decided to roll like that. It's JAMstack, so, I used outside
integrations to create a CMS, including $10/mo e-commerce functionality. I'm not
terribly proud of it, really, but this is a sort of a precursor to the work I
would come to do later, with the Sculptors Association of Alberta, in which
instance I executed the concept well (the concept being that of an online art
sale).

There's more to this, obviously. Someday.
